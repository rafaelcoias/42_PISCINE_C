# 42_PISCINE_C
For one month, the Piscine at 42 school lets you tackle the teaching methods of the school: peer-to-peer learning, group work, peer-evaluation and project pedagogy. Dive into the work methods of the students of 42. A month dedicated to stepping into programming for good.

This repository is all about the projects that I made during Piscine.
Every project has it's own subject.
And every project has new things to learn about C language.

Hope you like it !
